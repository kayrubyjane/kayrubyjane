# Hi there, I'm Arief Febrian (Kayrubyjane)! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate developer who has loved coding since middle school but became truly consistent once I started working. Currently, I'm working at **PT Yudhistira Ghalia Indonesia** as an IT Programmer and maybe a DevOps too, i guess(?).  

💻 **Specialties:**  
- Mainly focused on **Web Development**, but I can dive into **Mobile Development** too!  
- I enjoy **Frontend Development** more, but honestly, I'll take on any coding challenge! 😆
- Currently learning ![GCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Google%20Cloud-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white) and ![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-AWS-232F3E?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)

🌍 **Languages I Speak:**  
- 🇮🇩 Indonesian  
- 🇬🇧 English (Not a native speaker, but I manage 😁)
